Package: future.callr
=====================

Version: 0.3.0-9000 [2018-07-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 o The callr backend supports the handling of the standard output as
   implemented in future (>= 1.9.0).

BUG FIX:

 o Callr futures did not protect against recursive parallelism, e.g. with
   plan(list(callr, callr)) the second layer of futures would use the same
   number of workers as the first layer.


Version: 0.3.0 [2018-05-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Argument 'workers' of future strategies may now also be a function, which
   is called without argument when the future strategy is set up and used as
   is.  For instance, plan(callr, workers = halfCores) where
   halfCores <- function() { max(1, round(availableCores() / 2)) } will use
   half of the number of available cores.  This is useful when using nested
   future strategies with remote machines.

 o Gathering of results from background processes is made a little bit more
   robust against slow file systems by retrying a few times before accepting
   an error as an error.
  
CODE REFACTORING:

 o Prepared code to gather a richer set of results from futures.

BUG FIX:

 o Callr futures did not acknowledge timeout option 'future.wait.timeout'.
 

Version: 0.2.0 [2018-02-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Producing errors of class FutureError where applicable.

DOCUMENTATION:

 o Minor updates to the vignette related to the callr package.
 

Version: 0.1.1 [2017-11-18]

BUG FIX:

 o Number of workers in plan(callr, workers = n) was not respected.


Version: 0.1.0 [2017-11-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added callr futures. Use plan(callr) or plan(callr, workers = 4L).
