Package: future.callr
=====================

Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2018-05-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Argument 'workers' of future strategies may now also be a function, which
   is called without argument when the future strategy is set up and used as
   is.  For instance, plan(callr, workers = halfCores) where
   halfCores <- function() { max(1, round(availableCores() / 2)) } will use
   half of the number of available cores.  This is useful when using nested
   future strategies with remote machines.

 o Gathering of results from background processes is made a little bit more
   robust against slow file systems by retrying a few times before accepting
   an error as an error.
  
CODE REFACTORING:

 o Prepared code to gather a richer set of results from futures.

BUG FIX:

 o Callr futures did not acknowledge timeout option 'future.wait.timeout'.
